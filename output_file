This is SO EXCITING (up, 2) it was the best of times I was thinking... You were right As Elton John said: 'I am the most well-known homosexual in the world' Ready, set, GO! Welcome to the Brooklyn bridge I am exactly how they describe me: ''awesome'' There it was. An amazing rock! I was sitting over there, and then BAMM!! it was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, It Was The Age Of Foolishness (cap, 6), it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the (low, 3) winter of despair.
